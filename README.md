# Tabs For Later (Chrome Extension) 

*Made as a tool for my own use; this Chrome extension allows users to store and retrieve browser sessions for later use. Acts similar to the "Continue where you left off" setting that comes with Chrome, but what sets this extension apart from the Setting is the fact that a user isn't limited to only one browser session, as the extension supports the storage of several sessions.*

*Think: Bookmarks, but instead of one website, you can do it for several at once and store them under one name.*

Note: I currently have no plans of publishing the extension to the Chrome Web Store. However, I will be providing a Zip file containing all the required files to make the extension run incase anyone is interested in trying it out.
