# Tabs For Later (Chrome Extension) 
## STILL WORK IN PROGRESS
*Originally created because I was personally in need of something like this; this Chrome extension allows a user to save their browser sessions (i.e. save all the tabs currently open in a given browser) and re-open them again later.*

Libaries used:
- [Chrome API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/)
